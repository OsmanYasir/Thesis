# Automatic Payment Details Extraction Of Bills In Kyrgyzstan

This thesis presents the development and evaluation of a bill information extraction
system using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. The study encompasses
various aspects of image preprocessing, including grayscale conversion, normalization,
thresholding, and noise removal. Post-processing focuses on data extraction via pattern
recognition and field mapping. The system demonstrates satisfactory performance,
particularly for high-quality single-page preprocessed bills, highlighting the effectiveness of
the proposed techniques. The outcomes suggest potential for improvements, thereby
contributing to the expanding field of OCR and data extraction research.
